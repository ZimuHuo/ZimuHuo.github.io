Partial Fourier techniques aim to recover missing data using only half of the k-space. This reconstruction leverages the conjugate symmetry property of k-space, although it is sensitive to phase errors.

Here, I present a Projection onto Convex Sets (POCS) algorithm that finds the optimal solution by considering two criteria: 1. consistency with the acquired phase, and 2. consistency with the acquired k-space data.
