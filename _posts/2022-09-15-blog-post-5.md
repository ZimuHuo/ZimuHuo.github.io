Due to the alternating direction of the EPI readout lines, hardware imperfections such as timing delays, eddy currents, and gradient coil heating can cause misalignment of the forward and reverse lines in k-space. This misalignment manifests itself in the images as a Nyquist (N/2) ghost in the phase encode direction and sinusoidal modulation of the object in the frequency encode direction.

The entropy-based method attempts to minimize the image entropy of the magnitude image to minimize EPI misalignment artifacts

The low rank method attempts to promote self consistency in k-space to minimize EPI misalignment artifacts
