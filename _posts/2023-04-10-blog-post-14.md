The low rank based method will recover the missing data by enforcing self-consistency among neighboring k-space points in Cartesian space when minimizing the rank of the structured Hankel matrix. The self-consistency refers to the annihilation relationship being satisfied for all locations in k-space. Directly solving rank problems is computationally challenging and falls under the category of NP-hard problems. To address this, the non-convex rank function is replaced with its convex relaxation, which is replacing the non-convex rank function with its convex approximation, known as the nuclear norm.
