Due to the alternating direction of the EPI readout lines, hardware imperfections such as timing delays, eddy currents, and gradient coil heating can cause misalignment of the forward and reverse lines in k-space. This misalignment manifests itself in the images as a Nyquist (N/2) ghost in the phase encode direction and sinusoidal modulation of the object in the frequency encode direction.

The sampling incoherence is removed when interleving the positive and negative echos. However, a 2x acceleration is introduced to each dataset, resulting noise amplification
