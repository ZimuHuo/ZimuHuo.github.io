The slice-leakage is an artefact where the information from one slice is unintentionally transmitted to another slice during reconstruction. Any information from slice A that appears in slice B at the end of the reconstruction is considered slice leakage. The current method involves using a Monte Carlo simulation to impose unique frequency modulations on each slice. After reconstructions, the slice leakage can be determined by quantifying the frequency modulations on each individual slice. For example, if we add a 4 Hz modulation on slice A and a 6 Hz modulation on slice B, any 6 Hz component found on slice A after the reconstruction could be used to indicate slice leakage.
