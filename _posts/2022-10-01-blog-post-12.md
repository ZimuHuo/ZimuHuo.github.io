What if we combine SMS and inplane undersampling ? 

In this case, the sms data is acquired with slice fatctor of ns, and in plane factor of R (total = ns * R). To unfold the aliasing, one could arrange the data reconstruction as two separate steps. 
<br>
<br> 1. the slice grappa is used to separate the slice
<br> 2. the conventional grappa is then used along with reference data to unfold each individual slice.
