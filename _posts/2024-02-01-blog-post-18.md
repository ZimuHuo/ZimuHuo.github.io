In bSSFP, the entire spin evolution can be modeled mathematically through bloch equations, which can be broken down into three components: excitation E, relaxation R, and precession P. These three components are matrix operators representing the sequence events. Immediately after the RF pulse R, the spin undergoes T1 and T2 relaxation E and off-resonance precession P. The bSSFP sequence achieves the steady state by repetitively executing these operations, while ensuring that the gradients are refocused within each TR.
