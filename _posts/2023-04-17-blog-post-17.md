Partial Fourier techniques aim to recover missing data using only half of the k-space. This reconstruction leverages the conjugate symmetry property of k-space, although it is sensitive to phase errors.

Here, I present a Homodyne reconstruction that employs a more signal processing-oriented approach. It treats undersampling as a filter with different weightings for various frequency components in k-space, and attempts to apply the inverse of the filter to reverse the process.
