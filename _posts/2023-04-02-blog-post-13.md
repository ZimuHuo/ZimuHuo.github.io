The slice grappa tries to reduce the total artefact without placing constraints on the intraslice and interslice artifacts. So the artefacts can be arbitrarily large(like vectors pointing in opposite directions can cancel out each other, also called artefact cancellation). The split slice trades interslice artefact with intraslice artefact (lower interslice artefact and higher intraslice artefact) by forming a "correlation matrix" that contrains the interslice leakage to be minimum.
