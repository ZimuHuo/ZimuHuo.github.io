SENSE is a parallel imaging technique used to accelerate data acquisition in MRI.

In the original implementation of SENSE, the full-resolution coil sensitivity maps are estimated based on low-resolution calibration data. Consequently, high-resolution information is inherently absent. This contrasts with GRAPPA reconstruction, where high-resolution information is retained.

The advantage of SENSE lies in its simplicity, allowing for easy formulation as a forward model that can be solved through iterative reconstruction. See the next post for CG-SENSE (iterative reconstruction)
