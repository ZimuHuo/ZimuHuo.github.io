bSSFP suffers from unique banding artifacts, which are commonly corrected by using multiple phase cycles. These banding artifacts are a form of spatial modulation. While it is tricky to exploit this with SENSE (you will need coil maps and bssfp profile maps), this additional redundancy can be easily utilized by GRAPPA. To achieve this, we simply extend the GRAPPA kernel to include the phase cycle dimensions.
