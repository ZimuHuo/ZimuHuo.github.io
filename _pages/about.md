 Iâ€™m interested in developing advanced data acquisition methods and reconstruction algorithms in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
 
I began learning about MRI in mid-2022 as an undergraduate student. Over the past two years, alongside my studies, I taught myself more than 30 different reconstruction techniques. I believe the best way to ensure I understand something is by implementing it. To assist others, I have organized around 20 tutorials on basic reconstruction methods in my blog posts.
Here is an example:
