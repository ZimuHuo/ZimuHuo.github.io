Hi, I'm Zimu Huo, an MRI researcher with a passion for developing advanced data acquisition methods and reconstruction algorithms in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). My work spans optimization, signal modeling, and pulse sequence programming, aiming to enhance patient comfort and image quality. 

On my blog, I share tutorials, toolboxes, and insights from my research. 

Here is an example:
