Iâ€™m interested in developing advanced data acquisition methods and reconstruction algorithms in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
 
I believe the best way to ensure I understand something is by implementing it. To help others, I have organized around 20 tutorials on basic reconstruction methods in my blog posts.

Here are some examples: 
- [GRAPPA reconstruction tutorial](https://zimuhuo.github.io/posts/blog-post-1/)
- [EPI distortion tutorial part (1/2)](https://zimuhuo.github.io/posts/blog-post-7/)
- [Simulatenous Mulit-slice tutorial part (1/5)](https://zimuhuo.github.io/posts/blog-post-10/)
- [bSSFP tutorial part (1/2)](https://zimuhuo.github.io/posts/blog-post-18/)

You can also explore the MRI pulse and sequence simulation, image reconstruction, and post-processing toolboxes I created on my portfolio page.
