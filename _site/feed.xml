This method can be visualized as capturing all images within an extended field of view and then undersampling with a slice factor in a simulation.

<p>In this simulation of the SMS experiment, we concatenate multiple slices into an extended field of view. Techniques like SENSE and GRAPPA treat this extended field as a single image, applying the reconstruction in their original, unmodified form. However, GRAPPA techniques encounter difficulties in this scenario due to the CAIPI shift causing a phase discontinuity between the images. This sharp change cannot be captured by a small GRAPPA kernel. Since the GRAPPA kernel is small and bandlimited, its image domain representation is smooth and slowly varying, making it inadequate for capturing the sharp phase change.</p>
