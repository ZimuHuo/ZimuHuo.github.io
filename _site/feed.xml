However, this technique is prone to geometric distortions, which significantly degrade image quality. These distortions are primarily caused by field inhomogeneities, leading to voxel shifts. The voxel shifts are especially pronounced in the phase-encode direction. In this context, we explore the blip up and blip down approaches. I present a straightforward correction method based on line integrals to address these issues.</p>
